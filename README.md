# FIFA-20-Data-exploration

## Project overview
In this project I worked on some sports analytics using the Fifa dataset, this helped me getting used to a powerful library which is Plotly, this library provides interactive graphs using some JS, btw since github doesn't support JS, you download the html file the view all the graphs, and if you want to test the code feel free to download the .ipynb file.

## Data Description
The data has been provided by a Kaggle user (https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset) but you still can get it from other sources.
The dataset contains 6 files each one has the data related to a Fifa edition from Fifa 15 to Fifa 20, this data contains almost all the data about each Fifa player ( market value, wage, position, nationality ... ).

## Technical Overview
The project has been divided into various steps which include:

* Data Exploration and Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Data Visualization
